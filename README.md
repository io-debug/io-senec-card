The custom Card is available via HACS. 
Just add the github-Repository under "Home Assistant -> HACS -> Frontend", restart Home Assistant and add the Card to your Dashboard.
A visual editor is provided to make the configuration as easy as possible.

## Notes regarding the current Version
- The Card is currently just available in German
- The LED "St√∂rung" is just an indication. It's set, when the "Systemstatus" contains "Fehler".
- Please note, that custom Cards are often not shown on Mobile Apps.
